# Frogger
creating a JavaFX game</br>
When i Was little i use to play frogger i decide to recreate it using java fx. 
I use 6 rectangles for obstacle and 1 for the player
the 6 rectangles are moving with translate transition
the player is able to move left using (A), move right using (D) and move up using (W).
there is an  hp that Keep track of how many time you can touch the obstacle. 
when hp hit zero the game reset.
the score keep track how many time you win.

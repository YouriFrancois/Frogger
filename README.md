# Frogger
creating a JavaFX game</br>
When i Was little i use to play frogger i decide to recreate it using java fx. </br>
I use 6 rectangles for obstacle and 1 for the player.</br>
the 6 rectangles are moving with translate transition.</br>
the player is able to move left using (A), move right using (D) and move up using (W).</br>
there is an  hp that Keep track of how many time you can touch the obstacle. </br>
when hp hit zero the game reset.</br>
the score keep track how many time you win.</br>
